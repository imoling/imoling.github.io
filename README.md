## ✦ The First Principles

**iML Agent Desktop** is not just a chatbot. It is the evolution of the operating system interaction. 
Designed for those who demand more than conversation—it bridges the gap between AI reasoning and actual desktop execution.

> **"Transforms every computer into a desktop-level intelligent agent with real will."**

## ✦ Core Philosophy: Executive High-End

We break the boundary between AI and the OS. iML Agent possesses **Native Hooks** to sense system events and **Omni-Execution** capabilities to drive your workflow.

### 1. Omni-Perception (全域感知)
It sees what you see. Monitors file changes, identifies active app contexts, reads system notifications, and manages the clipboard. It is the agent's **eyes**.

### 2. Multi-Execution (多维执行)
It does what you need. From Shell scripts to GUI automation, from browser control to native app API calls. It is the agent's **hands**.

### 3. Vectra Persistence (认知持久)
It remembers everything. Transforms all fragmented information flowing through your system into a searchable local vector database. It is the agent's **brain**.

## ✦ Evolution System

The agent grows with you.
- **Skill Generation**: Describe a need (e.g., "Compress images over 1GB"), and it generates a standard skill plugin.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Through dialogue, it weaves skills into complex, automated workflows.

## ✦ Privacy First

**Local First, Privacy Always.**
Your commands, data, memory, and execution logs stay 100% on your device. No information is uploaded to third-party clouds for training.
- 🛡️ Local Storage
- 🔒 E2E Encryption
- 👁️ Zero Tracking

## 🛠 Tech Stack
